# EQ-Viz

An earthquake visualization tool built using data from the United States Geological Survey. Earthquake data is scraped in JSON format, then the relevant data is extracted and plotted using the matplotlib library. The tkinter library is used to provide the user with a gui, and the tkinter.ttk module is used to ensure cross-platform gui consistency.
